		<h2 id="about">About</h2>
		<p>The Cornerstone Shared Services Project, a non-profit, ministry-focused initiative sponsored by Epiphany Episcopal Church in Timonium, MD, continues Epiphany’s vision of supporting <span class="bold">“Spiritual Entrepreneurialism”</span> in a new way.
		<br/><br/>In today’s complex and quickly changing world, our churches are required to maintain <span class="bold">over 50 critical infrastructure processes</span> just to keep their doors open. Parish Administrators and Clergy report that they feel ill-equipped to handle all of these responsibilities. <span class="bold">Hundreds of hours</span> are spent as Rectors become facilities experts and Parish Administrators learn what SECA is, often resulting in expensive unintended outcomes.  Cornerstone wants to change this paradigm, creating a church-centric, cost-effective solution that creates ministry from administration for the benefit of the church and not for the benefit of any one individual or for-profit corporation.<br/><br/>
		Through the creation of a unique shared services model, our initial focus will be to support the <span class="bold">specialized accounting</span>, <span class="bold">communications</span>, <span class="bold">technology</span> and <span class="bold">administrative</span> needs of churches that don’t have or need full-time resources to perform these functions. Whether it is processing your payroll, keeping your social media presence fresh and inviting, creating pamphlets, baking communion bread, or any number of other support tasks for worship services, Cornerstone will get it done through our team of <span class="bold">full-time staff</span>, <span class="bold">bi-vocational clergy</span>, and <span class="bold">others</span> who join Cornerstone as a way to <span class="bold">learn new job skills</span>, <span class="bold">explore ministry</span>, and <span class="bold">deepen their faith</span> in service to one another.</p>
